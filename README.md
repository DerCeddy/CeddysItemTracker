Maptracker combined with features known from the [Gossip Stone Tracker]([url](https://github.com/Draeko/ootr_gst/tree/ladder_version)) made for competitive play
## Features
### Maptracker

Simple Maptracker with checklists to quickly track checks.

Green = You can do the check

Yellow = You can theoretically do the check but need to get one item to do it. For example beans or keys

Red = You can't do the check

To select another region leftclick any colored button. You can check an entire region with middleclicking the button.

### Hints

This works mostly the same like in the Gossip Stone Tracker. You can drag & drop items onto the gossip stones and can change the images of the path hints with mouse clicks or the wheel.

The main difference is the way how you "write" into the textboxes. Normally you would have to switch to your keyboard and write in it but here you can:

- Rightclick on a regionbutton to put the name into the topmost textbox in the path hint panel.

- Rightclick on a check to put the name into the topmost textbox in the sometimes hint panel.

To delete a wrong input just leftclick the textbox

### Stats

Here you can see how many checks you have done, how many are remaining and how many are accessible. 

You can also start a timer to show how many checks you did per hour.

### Customization

You can customize the various parts of the tracker and enable/disable shuffle settings in the config.json file, if you prefer a different layout or play with different settings.

## Bugs/Missing features

- Reset tracker doesn't reset gossip stones to default state
- Reset tracker doesn't reset textboxes to default state
- Various shuffle settings are missing
- Skulltula count isn't 100% accurate. I missed some skulltulas and need to check every single one again :(
